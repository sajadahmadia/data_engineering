# Customer Clustering ETL with Airflow and Tableau Cloud

In this repo, I've shared the files used in developing a data pipeline to cluster customers using Airflow and Tableau Cloud. The steps regarding this project are:

1. Creating a database using Azure MySQL Flexible Server 
2. Developing a Machine Learning clustering model in Python
3. Using Apache Airflow to orchestrate the ETL process
4. Loading the results to the MySQL database on Azure 
5. Using Tableau Cloud to transform the data further 
6. Visualizing the final results in Tableau Desktop and publishing the results
